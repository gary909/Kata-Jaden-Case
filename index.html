        Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith, is the star of films such as The Karate Kid (2010) and After Earth (2013). <br>
        Jaden is also known for some of his philosophy that he delivers via Twitter. When writing on Twitter, he is known <br>
        for almost always capitalizing every word. For simplicity, you'll have to capitalize each word, check out how <br>
        contractions are expected to be in the example below.<br>
        <br>
        Your task is to convert strings to how they would be written by Jaden Smith. The strings are actual quotes from <br>
        Jaden Smith, but they are not capitalized in the same way he originally typed them.<br>
        <br>
        Example:<br>
        <br>
        Not Jaden-Cased: "How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real"<br>
        Jaden-Cased:     "How Can Mirrors Be Real If Our Eyes Aren't Real"<br>
